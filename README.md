## Determinanti

This script is a self-implemented code to calculate the determinant of a matrix using the theoratical way and by not using a recursive function. Therefore, by increasing the dimensions of the matrix, the time for the calculation will increase exponentially. Therefore, it is a neither fast nor efficient method but it is beautiful just a link between theory and practice in a way.

## Libraries:

```
only Numpy and math libraries are needed.
```

## The Funtion

the function is located in the file named "determinanti.py" and "determinanti_2py". The first function is a little faster than the second one. Those two functions are called using the script in the file named "main.py" where you have to change the working directory as well as the matrix for which you are going to calculate its determinant.
``` 
determinanti_2(a)
determinanti(a)
```
where:
- a: is an n*n matrix

## Running the Script

```
Line 6 : please change the working directory
Line 11: provide the matrix of interest
Line 14: calling the first function to calculate the determinant 
Line 17: calling the second function to calculate the determinant
```

## Exmaple

 I have provided an example using a matrix "a".
